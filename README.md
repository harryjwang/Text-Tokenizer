# Text-Tokenizer
This project implements a tokenizer and text analyzer in C++. It reads plain-text input, breaks it into tokens, filters punctuation and whitespace, and produces structured outputs such as word frequencies or tokenized lists. The program is flexible enough to handle both small documents and large corpora, with an emphasis on efficiency in file I/O and data storage.

A key design feature is the separation between the tokenization process and the analysis logic. This makes it straightforward to add extensions, such as tracking bigrams, generating histograms, or integrating the tokenizer into larger pipelines like search or NLP systems.

This project also demonstrates how data structures like hash maps or tries can be paired with careful parsing logic to manage large volumes of unstructured text. It bridges the gap between raw string handling in C++ and higher-level text processing tasks typically seen in scripting languages, showing how lower-level languages can still excel in performance-sensitive environments.
